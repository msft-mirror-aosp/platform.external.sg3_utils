# This is the output (in hex) of a simulated SCSI ZONE QUERY command.

# The hex bytes in this file may be generated by:
#     sg_z_act_query /dev/sg1 -HHH > /tmp/z_act_query.hex
# where /dev/sg1 was a SCSI device implementing ZBC-2.

# An example invocation:
#    sg_z_act_query --inhex=z_act_query.hex
