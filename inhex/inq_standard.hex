# This file contains the ASCII hex of a SCSI INQUIRY command
# 'standard' response. In this case non-standard responses refers
# to responses contain VPD page that are also fetched with the
# SCSI INQUIRY command.

# The response in this file can be decoded with:
#     sg_inq --inhex=inq_standard.hex
# or
#     sg_vpd --inhex=inq_standard.hex --page=sinq
#
# The sg_inq utility defaults to the 'standard' INQUIRY while the
# sg_vpd utility defaults to the "Supported VPD pages" VPD page.
# Hence sg_vpd needs the extra option '--page=sinq' which says the
# VPD page is the standard inquiry. Strictly speaking the standard
# INQUIRY is not a VPD page but probably would be if SCSI was not
# 40 years old and highly values backward compatibility.
