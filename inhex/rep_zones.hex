# This is the output (in hex) of the SCSI REPORT ZONES command
# from a simulated ZBC device from the scsi_debug driver in Linux.
# The parameters to the scsi_debug driver given to modprobe were:
#     dev_size_mb=512 zbc=managed zone_size_mb=128 zone_nr_conv=1
#
# The hex bytes in this file were generated by:
#     sg_rep_zones /dev/sg1 -HHH > /tmp/rep_zones.hex
# where /dev/sg1 was a scsi_debug device.

# An example invocation:
#    sg_rep_zones --inhex=rep_zones.hex


# parameter data header (64 bytes)
