# The is a real response to the SCSI GET PHYSICAL ELEMENT STATUS command.
# The storage elements are associated with heads on this hard disk and
# one of them (element_id: 10) is "out of spec". The same output was
# obtained with --report-type=1 (report only storage elements) as this
# invocation (where --report-type defaults to 0: report all physical
# elements):
#    sg_get_elem_status -HHH <dev>
#
# The hard disk had 9 platters and thus had 18 heads as both side of each
# platter are used.
